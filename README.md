# Welcome to Atari Games
Reinforcement Learning for Atari Games Optimization

## Task
In this project, we aim to optimize gameplay in Atari games using reinforcement learning techniques. The challenge is to develop a reinforcement learning agent that can learn from its interactions with the environment to make optimal decisions on actions to take, in order to maximize the game score.

## Description
We have implemented reinforcement learning algorithms to train agents for playing classic Atari games such as Cartpole, Space Invaders, and Ms. Pac-Man. We have utilized deep neural networks to train the agents, and have experimented with different algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize their performance.

## Installation
To install the project, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries and dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file.
Launch the project in a Python environment with the necessary dependencies.

## Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

Set up the game environment and agent by running the provided scripts.
Train the agent using reinforcement learning algorithms.
Evaluate the performance of the agent and observe the results.
Fine-tune the agent and experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize its performance.
Use the trained agent to play Atari games and observe its gameplay.
